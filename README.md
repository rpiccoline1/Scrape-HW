# Scrape-HW

This hw is designed to test the ability to create a simple app that will scrape information from a chosen new site and display the information to the user.  The user can then click on any of the headlines which will bring up a modal that will allow them to add comments.  These comments, along with the scraped data, will be stored in collections in MongoDB.
